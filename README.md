# Scratch-n-Sketch

scratch_n_sketch : A kit that teaches you how to code and electronics.

no compilaton needed just plug the board to the computer and start coding in python or drag and drop using scratch language
Access to onboard sensors, write to the lcd screen and interface with external sensors e.g temparature, humidity, proximity, sound e.t.c

#python  
python examples for scratch-n-sketch board. 
install python 3 and the following dependencies to get started

python download : https://www.python.org/downloads/

dependencies:  
* pyserial for python 3 : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial#downloads   

others useful:
* pyautogui : programmatically control the mouse & keyboard. https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/P/PyAutoGUI/PyAutoGUI-0.9.30.zip  
* requests - provides most of the HTTP capabilities you need. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/
* pywapi - wrapper around different weather APIs. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywapi

you can use any text editor to write python scripts but in our case we prefer using atom (by GitHub)
* download atom editor at http://atom.io

once installed open server folder->scratch_n_sketch.exe and click start. The server will auto search and connect.You're ready to start scratching. (you'll get a connectional successful log)

open scratch app->file->new .Hold shift while clicking file->new->import experimental http extension. Open blocks folder and load scratch_blocks.s2e

find the blocks in the more blocks section.

#arduino
you also connect scratch-n-sketch kit to most of official/compatible arduino boards.
all you need is an SPI cable and an arduino board.
